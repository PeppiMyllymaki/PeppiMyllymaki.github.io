<h2>About Me</h2>
<div class="about-content">
<img src="img/pikkupeppi.png" alt="My Photo" class="profile-pic"> </img>
<p>
I'm a game programming engineering student finishing my degree. I combine my 
technical coding skill with strong visual and creative capabilities.
I enjoy building things that sit between storytelling, design and technology; 
from websites to 3D visuals, interactive experiences and videogames.
<br><br>
I work with C#, C++, Unity, Unreal Engine, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, 
and I’ve created several websites both with and without frameworks. 
I also have experience in 3D modeling, animation, photogrammetry, Blender, 
XAMPP, and graphic design. Lately I’ve been expanding my skills in working with data, 
Excel and basic data processing workflows.
<br><br>
My working style is calm, responsible and thorough. I’m comfortable taking initiative, 
guiding a team when needed, and learning new tools quickly. I’m especially motivated 
by projects where I can merge code, visual storytelling and interactive design.
<br><br>
I’m looking for a role where I can create impactful digital experiences; whether 
through data-driven visuals, interactive stories, game-like experiences, or new experimental 
formats that mix design and code.

I developed the Gamelab website, following designs created in Figma by the project lead. My goal was to build 
a modern, visually appealing, and responsive site while implementing features like downloadable assets, 
interactive media galleries, and dynamic buttons.

<br></br><br> </br>
<b>What I did</b>
<br></br>
<ul class="accordion-list">

<li>Documented issues and requested feedback via a collaborative document to streamline development and ensure accuracy.</li>
<li>Took initiative in coming up with ideas for improving the website both in it's interactivity and content.</li>
</ul>

<br></br>
<b>Result</b>
<br>

my skills in web development, problem-solving, and collaborative design implementation. Over many months, I built multiple pages, 
solved technical challenges, and polished the website to completion.
<br></br>
Currently the first version is up, and the second and final rendition is waiting for approval from management. The second rendition has many new pages, 
features and polish.

As part of the “Future of Game Technologies” course, I acted as the photogrammer for our project. I explored various photogrammetry tools such as RealityScan and Meshroom, learning their workflows, limitations, and requirements. While many attempts resulted in unsuccessful models, I successfully integrated a functional 3D model into our project, gaining hands-on experience with the full photogrammetry pipeline.

<br></br><br></br>
<b>What I did</b>
<ul class="accordion-list">
<li>Experimented with multiple photogrammetry tools to capture and process real-world objects into 3D models.</li>
<li>Learned about lighting, angles, and processing requirements for successful model generation.</li>
<li>Integrated a final successful 3D model into the project’s environment.</li>
<li>Analyzed failures to improve techniques and understanding of photogrammetry workflows.</li>
</ul>

<br></br>
<b>Result</b>
<br></br>
Gained practical experience with photogrammetry, successfully contributing a usable 3D model to the project, and developed a strong foundation to explore more advanced photogrammetry techniques in the future.

This Task Manager project is a full-stack application I developed to practice backend functionalities and user management features. It allows users to                     create, read, update, and delete tasks, with role-based privileges (user, moderator, admin) and session-based authentication. The app demonstrates                           CRUD operations, multiple HTTP methods, and role-specific UI.

<br></br><br></br>
<b>What I did</b>
<ul class="accordion-list">
<li>Designed and implemented a scalable backend using Node.js and Express to manage tasks and users.</li>
<li>Implemented role-based access control: users can manage their own tasks, moderators can view all tasks, and admins can delete any task.</li>
<li>Created secure login and registration with hashed passwords and session management for authorization.</li>
<li>Developed task functionalities with full CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and different views for completed, pending, and all                             tasks.</li>
<li>Implemented frontend feedback, including color changes and messages when tasks are completed.</li>
<li>Designed admin and moderator panels to clearly differentiate privileges and visibility of tasks.</li>
<li>Integrated client-side features with backend API to demonstrate full-stack application workflow.</li>
</ul>

<br></br>
<b>Result</b>
<br></br>
A fully functional task management system showcasing full-stack development skills, including secure user authentication, role-based access control, and responsive UI features.

<h2>Education</h2>
<p>
I am completing (and soon graduating from) a Bachelor of Engineering (AMK) in Game Programming at Kaakkois-Suomen 
ammattikorkeakoulu (XAMK), with a strong academic record (GPA 4.24). My studies have given me a broad foundation 
across multiple areas of game development, including programming (C#, C++), game engine workflows (Unity, Unreal), 
3D modeling and animation, graphics, web development (HTML, CSS, JS), game design, physics and mathematics for games, 
data management, and digital security.
<br></br><br></br>
My studies have provided me with a wide-ranging toolkit to approach both technical and creative challenges in game and 
interactive media development, as well as in broader digital projects.
